                    My name is Benjamin Seguin-Frank, I am a driven and adaptable junior software developer and computer science specialist. I have hands-on experience working on various software projects in both a professional and academic setting, from my time as a student software developer for the Government of Canada—Employment and Social Services (ESDC) and studying at Carleton University.

At the Government of Canada, I was responsible for automating processes, including aggregating Pension Web Service logs and generating insightful dashboard reports to support decision-making. My ability to quickly adapt to new tools, such as Power BI, Azure DevOps, ELK Stack, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, and my commitment to producing high-quality solutions contributed significantly to the success of the team’s projects.

I have experience in a multitude of languages and applications, My technical skills include the following:

- Proficiency in C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Python, GDScript, Haskell, Grok and various other programming languages.

- Experience in 3D Graphics/software development using OpenGL and various other 3D Graphics engines (such as Godot and Unity).

- Experience with MySQL, MongoDB, PostGres, and various other Database creation and querying languages,

- proficiency in a multitude of web-based languages such as Javascript, .NET, C#, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and Pug

I have employed these skills to complete many personal and academic projects, furthering my abilities to work on and develop large-scale software applications collaboratively. A full list of my completed projects can be found below.
