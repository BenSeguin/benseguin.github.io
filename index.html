                    My name is Benjamin Seguin-Frank, welcome to my website! 

                    Here you can use the navigation bar to view a gallery of my completed projects, as well as get a list of all my personal contacts!

                    But first, a bit about myself:

                    I am a dedicated 4th-year student of Computer Science at Carleton University. I have hands-on experience with programming and computers and have managed several teams to deliver successful software applications on time and within specifications.
                    
                    During my studies I have gained practical and technical experience with a variety of software applications and programming languages such as: Java, C,  C++, Postgres, MongoDB, and QMake. The variety of personal and academic projects I have developed have allowed me to hone and improve my skills in these various software applications and make me an ideal candidate for any team.

                    I have experience with 3D Graphics and basic graphics Libraries such as OpenGL. During my Second- and Third-year Game Development courses, I led a small team to design and create 2D and 3D games from scratch using OpenGL. This experience of managing a team has made me proficient in GitHub and version control; as well as other tenants of the Agile management model, such as hosting daily scrum meetings and coordinating our goals for a weekly sprint.
